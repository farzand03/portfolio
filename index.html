          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello, I'm Farzan, a third-year electrical engineering student with a passion for crafting websites and web applications from the ground up using various programming languages. Self-taught in this domain, I've embarked on a journey of continuous learning and exploration, honing my skills in web development with each project undertaken.
            
            <br><br>Alongside my university studies, I've had the privilege of working as an intern engineer at BHP, where I've gained firsthand experience in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world projects. This experience has provided me with invaluable insights into the practical aspects of electrical engineering, allowing me to enhance my problem-solving abilities and technical proficiency.
            
            <br><br>Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I find immense fulfillment in giving back to my community through volunteering. Currently, I devote my time to Save the Children, contributing to their noble cause with dedication and compassion. Additionally, I serve as a STEM study buddy, sharing my knowledge and enthusiasm for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics with students eager to explore these fields.
            
            <br><br>In essence, I am a driven individual fueled by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to make a positive impact in both my academic journey and the wider community.</p>

            <p>My journey in web development started off with html, css and javascript - the fundamental langugaes for website building.
              Here, I gained my first insight into the world of programming and the vast capabilities of it. I began to enjoy generating 
              my own creations and seeing what I could produce. <br><br>
              Recently I have been experimenting and attempting to learn various other more modern programming languages such as nodejs,
              typescript and react to craft more complex web applications. <br><br>
              Web development has been something that I learnt myself through scowering through the internet and learning from various free
              tutorials and videos - and so by no means would I say I am an expert in this field! However, I'm always looking to learn and
              develop my skills in this field as I thoroughly enjoy it.</p>

            <h2>Electrical Engineering</h2>
            <p>Transitioning into university, as part of my degree, I was required me to undertake units involving python, c and matlab. In both python and c,
              I created simple games and simulations. These projects helped build my knowledge of fundamental concepts such 
              as arrays, conditonal logic and statements, loops, file structures and much more. <br><br>
              For matlab, I have been learning to use the software to plot and visualise electromagnetic vector fields, for designing signal processing
              filters, and for solving and modelling mathematics problems. <br><br>
              Aside from the programming side of things, I have also been immersed into a world of complex mathematics, been exposed to configuring
              microcontrollers through using fundamental principles of boolean logic, and overall become a much better problem solver through my
              journey as an electrical engineering student.
