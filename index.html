          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello, I'm Farzan, a third-year electrical engineering student with a passion for crafting websites and web applications from the ground up using various programming languages. Self-taught in this domain, I've embarked on a journey of continuous learning and exploration, improving my skills in web development with each project undertaken.
            
            <br><br>Alongside my university studies, I've had the privilege of working as an intern engineer in various different departments at BHP, where I've gained firsthand experience in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world projects. This experience has provided me with invaluable insights into the practical aspects of electrical engineering, allowing me to enhance my problem-solving abilities and technical proficiency.
            
            <br><br>Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I find immense fulfillment in giving back to my community through volunteering. Currently, I devote my time to Save the Children, contributing to their noble cause with dedication and compassion. Additionally, I serve as a STEM study buddy, sharing my knowledge and enthusiasm for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics with students eager to explore these fields.
            
            <br><br>In essence, I am a driven individual fueled by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to make a positive impact in the world through technical excellence.</p>

            <p>My journey in web development started off with html, css and javascript - the fundamental langugaes for website building.
              Here, I gained my first insight into the world of programming and the vast capabilities of it. I began to enjoy generating 
              my own creations and seeing what I could produce. <br><br>
              Recently I have been experimenting and attempting to learn various other more modern programming languages such as nodejs,
              typescript and react to craft more complex web applications. <br><br>
              Web development has been something that I learnt myself through scowering through the internet and learning from various free
              tutorials and videos - and so by no means would I say I am an expert in this field! However, I'm always looking to learn and

            <h2>Electrical Engineering</h2>
            <p>Transitioning into university, as part of my degree, I was required me to undertake units involving python, c and matlab. In both python and c,
              I created simple games and simulations. These projects helped build my knowledge of fundamental concepts such 
              as arrays, conditonal logic and statements, loops, file structures and much more. <br><br>
              For matlab, I have been learning to use the software to plot and visualise electromagnetic vector fields, for designing signal processing
              filters, and for solving and modelling mathematics problems. <br><br>
              Aside from the programming side of things, I have also been immersed into a world of complex mathematics, been exposed to configuring
              microcontrollers through using fundamental principles of boolean logic, and overall become a much better problem solver through my
              journey as an electrical engineering student.

            <h2>Collaboration</h2>
            <p>Throughout my various internships, I have noticed that collaboration has always been essential to ensure success in any realm.
              Whether collaborating with subject matter experts to overcome deficiencies in knowledge, or collaborating
              with group members to produce a final solution, collaboration is a skill that I consider to be essential.
              <br><br>Through my various experiences, I believe I have practiced many of the skills it takes to collaborate well,
              such as active listening, clear communication, inclusivity to promote the flow of ideas, and a whole lot more.
